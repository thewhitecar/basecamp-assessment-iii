# Basecamp JavaScript III Stretch Project

## Objective
Show an understanding of the React concepts taught in Basecamp. This project should be difficult as a lot of information is purposefully left out. It will force you to search out resources. Good luck!

## Step 1

* `Fork` and `clone` this repository and then `cd` into it.
* If you don't have `create-react-app` installed, do so by running `npm install -g create-react-app`.
* Run `create-react-app app`in the desired directory. ( This will create a folder called app )
* Open the newly created `app` folder in your editor.

## Step 2

* Clear out all styling from `App.css`.
* Run `npm start` in your terminal to start your newly created app in the broswer.
* Don't worry, everything is fine! It should be a blank page.

## Step 3

* Using what you have learned, try to create three new components and render them onto the page.
* This should stretch what you have learned so far and you may need to search for more resources on your own.
* This project will not have any merit on your continuing with DevMountain and is more for the exposure to React so go wild and try your very best!

## Step 4

When you have completed the challenge please follow these instructions:

* Open the terminal and navigate to where this assessment is.
* Commit all of your completed code.
* Type `git checkout -b gh-pages`
* Type `git push -u origin gh-pages`
* Find your account name on github and insert it into this url `http://[YourGithubAccountName].github.io/basecamp-assessment-iii`
* Open that url to make sure it works, then send that url to basecamp@devmountain.com!
